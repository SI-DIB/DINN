# DINN
Distribution-Informed Neural Network (DINN) for Battery Degradation Modeling: A novel hybrid model combining Weibull distribution with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH) prediction of Lithium-ion batteries.

## Installation To run the DINN model, follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/DINN.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    `cd DINN`
3. Install the required packages:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage After installation, 
you can run the model with the following commands: 
1. For training the DINN model on your dataset:
     `python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>`
2. For testing the model and plotting results:
     `python evaluate.py --model <path_to_model>`
